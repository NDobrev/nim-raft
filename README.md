# nim-raft

This project aims to develop an implementation of the Raft consensus protocol that allows for application-specific customizations of the protocol.

We plan to leverage the implementation to create a highly-efficient setup for operating a redundant set of Nimbus beacon nodes and/or validator clients that rely on BLS threshold signatures to achieve improved resilience and security. Further details can be found in our roadmap here:
